<p>My full name is Hai-Nguyen Nguyen, also known by my initials (t√™n ch·ªØ/Ë°®Â≠ó/Ïûê) - Hann. My main research focus is on aerial robotics. Currently, I am a Contract Research Scientist at LAAS-CNRS, focusing on control and planning aspects of aerial physical interaction. </p>

I recently decided to go back to Github, after three years on gitlab and redmine. Thanks for dropping by!

<h2> About Me</h2>

In my view, robotics is a genuine symbiosis of science and engineering. I feel fortunate to have chances working on both the yin and yang of robotics: from proving theorems on papers to coding software on product-grade robots.
