<p>My full name is Hai-Nguyen Nguyen, also known by my initials (tên chữ/表字/자) - Hann. Currently, I am a Lecturer on Robotics and Mechatronics at RMIT, South Saigon Campus, Vietnam.

In my view, robotics is a genuine symbiosis of science and engineering. I feel fortunate to have chances working on both the yin and yang of robotics: from proving theorems on papers to coding software on product-grade robots. My current focus is on developing a new generation of physically-capable aerial robots.
